Idea:

    User inputs letter in the console. The program chooses a random city, country, river (Stadt, Land, Fluss) from a list. The game can be played over multiple rounds. When the computer is out of words in any category, a message is displayed.
    For the practice of objects and arrays. Each city, country, river array will include respective entries as objects. Each of these entries will have a 'played' property, to keep track of which entries have been played so far.
    To reduce the work load, the program will be restricted to vocal letters only.


Structure:

    The game will have one array of objects storing all cities, countries and rivers starting with a,e,i,o,u and g ...

        _type: string, indicating wether it's a city, country or river
        _name: string, the name...
        wasPlayed: bool, indicating if the object has been chosen before.


Program Flow:
    1. User enters a letter
    2. Program filters for items that starting with the inputLetter from the user.
    3. Program filters for array of still available elements (that have not been played)
    4. Program returns result:
            Either a ranomly chosen element of each object._type 
            Or Print 'I dont have a [object._type] starting with [inputLetter]


Notes:
    Consider to have the code run in do-while, ... only quit after exit from user input..
